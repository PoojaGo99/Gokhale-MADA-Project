  abstract  = "Bladder cancer, a prevalent malignancy affecting the urinary
               system, arises from the tissues of the bladder, a hollow organ
               responsible for storing urine (see Image. Bladder Cancer,
               Magnetic Resonance Image). Urothelial carcinoma is the most
               frequent type of bladder cancer, constituting over 90\% of cases
               in industrialized nations. This type of cancer is notably common
               among older adults, with risk factors including smoking,
               chemical exposure, and chronic bladder inflammation. Presenting
               symptoms such as gross or microscopic hematuria, urinary
               frequency, and unexplained pelvic pain typically lead to its
               detection. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for
               improving outcomes, as bladder cancer can range from noninvasive
               forms that are confined to the inner layers of the bladder to
               invasive types that penetrate deeper and can spread to other
               parts of the body. Treatment primarily involves transurethral
               resection and intravesical chemotherapy instillations but may
               also include laser ablation, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin bladder
               treatments, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgical removal
               of part or all of the bladder. This activity reviews the
               intricacies of bladder cancer, from its etiology to its
               therapeutic strategies. The latest advancements and
               comprehensive knowledge in diagnosing, treating, and managing
               this prevalent malignancy are discussed. Participants gain
               enhanced diagnostic acumen, learn evidence-based treatment
               protocols, and are updated on emerging research, fostering a
               deeper understanding of bladder cancer's evolving landscape and
               ultimately improving clinical practice. The role of the
               interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this
               common malignant condition. Collaborating with an
               interprofessional team enhances patient outcomes by integrating
               diverse expertise, ensuring comprehensive treatment plans, and
               providing holistic care that addresses all aspects of the
               patient's health. This improves the overall management and
               prognosis of bladder cancer.",
